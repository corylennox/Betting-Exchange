Terms we should know:
Outright betting
Moneyline
Point spread

To Do:
order contender rows by odds
make tailwind theme
Use HeadlessUI for sidebar, navbar, and bottomnavbar? (already using for active theme button)
make admin panel (look into refinedev/refine on git)

Process betslip submissions by sending to backend
Double check the logic in wagerWinUtils.js to make sure we are doing what fanduel does with regards to Math.floor() and Math.ceil()
Implement commission into the betslip and backend (total, commission, To Win)
Make it so that the "Featured" tab is the same as the "Home" tab. Same URL as well?



- Revise commit history to get rid of any history in the Github repo with the .env files. All commits should have no data regarding .env.
- Rename buttonId in frontend & backend?

- Change any line/wager/payout from Float to Int
- Find a way to avoid passing totalPayout thru to backend. Setup some rule where totalPayout is not necessary and the rule can be applied on wagerAmount & line to determine totalPayout
- in the submitBetslip mutation, check if the user is authorized (logged in)

- dividers between grid columns in OutrightBets

- When we update the css, color scheme, and branding for the website, don't forget about updating the Auth0 branding in the user dashboard

- Once we move to a public webiste and off of localhost, we need to setup CORS according to
  https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/cors/#apis-with-known-consumers

- Switch the PubSub class usage into PubSubEngine for production use, as described in:
  https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/

- use ints for all JS numbers to avoid decimal floating point precision. Create hard coded constant values (scale vars) in the front end so front end can reference when converting to decimal

- Create a buttonId table with all the historic and active buttonIds and their associated betTypes.

- We want a user experience like Fanduel. I.e., the user basically always gets filled on their orders.
  Therefore, over the websocket we will send 2 price levels for each side of each buttonId. And the frontend will allow a max bet up to the sum of the wager amounts for those two price levels.

- V2: Pro version of our app that allows users to have access to limit orders and selling on the outright betslip
